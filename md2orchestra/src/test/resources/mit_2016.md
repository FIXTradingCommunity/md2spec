| AdditionalMargin         | 1     | 1644001 | Additional Margin Component of the total margin calculation which allows the CCP to include amounts generated outside of the Margin Deficit. Additional risk charges collected when a firm is placed on higher than normal surveillance.          Additional margin serves to cover the additional liquidation costs that potentially could be incurred. Such possible close-out costs could arise if, based on the current market value of a portfolio, the worst case loss were to occur within a 24-hour period. It is used for options (also options on futures) and non-spread futures positions, bonds and equity trades. For bonds and equity trades, the additional margin is calculated for security positions but not for the corresponding cash positions. |
| AdjustedMargin           | 2     | 1644002 | Adjusted Margin Unadjusted Margin can be modified to become an Adjusted Margin by assigning a specific collateral to it or by applying an exchange rate.                                                                                                                               |
| UnadjustedMargin         | 3     | 1644003 | Unadjusted Margin Calculated by adding up the options Premium Margin, the current Liquidating Margin, the Futures Spread Margin and the Additional Margin on account and currency level.                                                                                                                               |
| BinaryAddOnAmount        | 4     | 1644004 | Binary Add-On Amount Requirement generated from positions in Binary Options which are considered fully margined.

This amount is included as a component of Additional Margin in the Total Margin calculation.                                                                                                                               |
| CashBalanceAmount        | 5     | 1644005 | Cash Balance Amount Information about cash balance posted to the clearing house to cover the current margin requirement.                                                                                                                               |
| ConcentrationMargin      | 6     | 1644006 | Concentration Margin Reflects a riskier portfolio concentration when a set of closely related products is held.                                                                                                                               |
| CoreMargin               | 7     | 1644007 | Core Margin Specific basic requirement of a position.

| DeliveryMargin           | 8     | 1644008 | Delivery Margin Margin amount calculated between the Last Trade Date or Options Exercise Date and the Delivery or Settlement Date. Can also represent a commodities or energy delivery.                                                                                                                               |
| DiscretionaryMargin      | 9     | 1644009 | Discretionary Margin Unspecific margin amount added by the risk manager, also called Increase Coverage Amount.                                                                                                                               |
| FuturesSpreadMargin      | 10    | 1644010 | Futures Spread Margin Long and short positions of futures with different expiration dates can be offset against each other and are called �spreads�. The remaining risk stems from the difference in expiration dates which does not provide a perfect price correlation. The purpose of Futures Spread Margin is to cover this risk until the next trading day.          This kind of margin is levied in order to cover those risks associated with a futures spread which could arise between today and tomorrow.                                                                                                                               |

| LiquidatingMargin        | 12    | 1644012 | Liquidating Margin Calculated for cash, bond and equity positions and is equal to the profits and losses in such positions at the time of calculation. This margin protects the CCP if it is required to close out the position at the current/EOD price.          The liquidating margin (also called Current Liquidating Margin or Net Liquidating Margin) is paid by the buyer or the seller of the bonds. This margin covers losses that would occur if a position were to be liquidated today. The liquidating margin is adjusted daily similar to premium margin.                                                                                                                               |

This amount represents anticipated losses should the value of a portfolio (all positions in the account) fall below predefined level of Historical Value-at-Risk confidence. Also called Expected Shortfall Amount.                                                                                                                               |
| MarginExcessAmount       | 15    | 1644015 | Margin Excess Amount (Surplus) Excess long premium value which is generated when long premium value exceeds the sum of any short premium debit requirement and the account's risk charges. Also called Expected Surplus Amount or Margin Credit Amount.                                                                                                                               |

| PremiumMargin            | 17    | 1644017 | Premium Margin Premium margin must be deposited by the seller of a traditional options position. It remains effective until the exercise or expiration of the option, and covers the potential costs of a close-out (liquidation) of the position of the seller at the settlement price.                                                                                                                               |

| StressTestAddOnAmount    | 20    | 1644020 | Stress Test Add-On Amount Amount in addition to Margin Deficit in the Risk component of the margin calculation. This charge is based on tests which incorporate changes to distributional and confidence level assumptions to evaluate exposure to security concentration and changes in dependence structure; a predetermined percentage of the calculated exposure is collateralized as this charge.                                                                                                                               |

| MarginRequirementInquiry                | CH    | 35119 | MarginRequirementInquiry The purpose of this message is to initiate a margin requirement inquiry for a margin account. The inquiry may be submitted at the detail level or the summary level. It can also be used to inquire margin excess/deficit or net position information. Margin excess/deficit will provide information about the surplus or shortfall compared to the previous trading day or a more recent margin calculation. An inquiry for net position information will trigger one or more PositionReport messages instead of one or more MarginRequirementReport messages.          If the inquiry is made at the detail level, an Instrument block must be provided with the desired level of detail. If the inquiry is made at the summary level, the Instrument block is not provided, implying a summary request is being made. For example, if the inquiring firm specifies the Security Type of �FUT� in the Instrument block, then a detail report will be generated containing the margin requirements for all futures positions for the inquiring account. Similarly, if the inquiry is made at the summary level, the report will contain the total margin requirement aggregated to the margin account level.                                    |

| AccountSummaryReport                    | CQ    | 35127 | AccountSummaryReport The AccountSummaryReport is provided by the clearinghouse to its clearing members on a daily basis. It contains margin, settlement, collateral and pay/collect data for each clearing member level account type. Clearing member account types will be described through use of the Parties component and PtysSubGrp sub-component.

For example, clearing members can send this message to the clearinghouse to identify the value of collateral for each customer (to satisfy CFTC Legally Segregated Operationally Commingled (LSOC) regulatory reporting obligations).          Clearing organizations can also send the AccountSummaryReport message to regulators to meet regulatory reporting obligations. For example, clearing organizations can use this message to submit daily reports for each clearing member (�CM�) by house origin and by each customer origin for all futures, options, and swaps positions, and all securities positions held in a segregated account or pursuant to a cross margining agreement, to a regulator (e.g. to the CFTC to meet Part 39, Section 39.19 reporting obligations). |

### Codeset QuoteTypeCodeSet type int (537)

Identifies the type of quote.          An indicative quote is used to inform a counterparty of a market. An indicative quote does not result directly in a trade.          A tradeable quote is submitted to a market and will result directly in a trade against other orders and quotes in a market.          A restricted tradeable quote is submitted to a market and within a certain restriction (possibly based upon price or quantity) will automatically trade against orders. Order that do not comply with restrictions are sent to the quote issuer who can choose to accept or decline the order.          A counter quote is used in the negotiation model. See Volume 7 - Product: Fixed Income for example usage.

### Codeset TradeContingencyCodeSet type int (2387)

Indicates the contingency attribute for a trade in an asset class that may be contingent on the clearing of a corresponding paired trade (for example Exchange for Physical (EFP), Exchange for Swap (EFS), Exchange for Related (EFR) or Exchange for Option (EFO), collectively called EFRPs). Once the paired trade clears or fails to clear, the related trade (the trade which carries this attribute) ceases to exist.

|------------------------------------|-------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NoBookOrderDueToAverageSpreadPrice | 0     | 2670001 | No preceding order in book as transaction price set within average spread of a liquid instrument Per MiFIR Article 4(1)(b)(i) the obligation to place a public order can be waived for transactions of liquid instruments on "systems that formalise negotiated transactions which are made within the current volume weighted spread reflected on the order book or the quotes of the market makers of the trading venue operating that system, subject to the conditions set out in Article 5" of MiFIR on volume caps. "Liquid markets" as per MiFIR Article 2(17)(b) are assessed by the regulator for the purposes of MiFIR Articles 4, 5 and 14. For ESMA RTS 1, this is the "NLIQ" flag. |
| NoBookOrderDueToRefPrice           | 1     | 2670002 | No preceding order in book as transaction price depends on system-set reference price for an illiquid instrument Per MiFIR Article 4(1)(b)(ii) the obligation to place a public order can be waived for "negotiated transactions which are in an illiquid share, depositary receipt, ETF, certificate or other similar financial instrument that does not fall within the meaning of a liquid market, and are dealt within a percentage of a suitable reference price, being a percentage and a reference price set in advance by the system operator." For ESMA RTS 1, this is the "OLIQ" flag.                                                                                                |
| NoBookOrderDueToOtherConditions    | 2     | 2670003 | No preceding order in book as transaction price is for transaction subject to conditions other than current market price Per MiFIR Article 4(1)(b)(iii), the obligation to place a public order can be waived in "systems that formalise negotiated transactions which are subject to conditions other than the current market price of that financial instrument." For ESMA RTS 1, this is the "PRIC" flag.                                                                                                                               |
| NoPublicPriceDueToRefPrice         | 3     | 2670004 | No public price for preceding order as public reference price was used for matching orders Per MiFIR Article 4(1)(a) the obligation to place a public order can be waived for "systems matching orders based on a trading methodology by which the price of the financial instrument is derived from the trading venue where that financial instrument was first admitted to trading or the most relevant market in terms of liquidity, where that reference price is widely published and is regarded by market participants as a reliable reference price." For ESMA RTS 1, this is the "RFPT" flag.                                                                                          |
| NoPublicPriceDueToIlliquid         | 4     | 2670005 | No public price quoted as instrument is illiquid According to Article 14(1) MiFIR the systematic internaliser was not obliged to publish the quote prior to closing the trade as it was made in an illiquid instrument. For ESMA RTS 1, this is the "ILQD" flag.                                                                                                                               |
| NoPublicPriceDueToOrderSize        | 5     | 2670006 | No public price quoted as order is above standard market size ESMA: As per Article 14(2) MiFIR, the systematic internaliser was not obliged to quote prior to closing the trade as the trade was above the instrument's standard market size. For ESMA RTS 1, this is the "SIZE" flag.                                                                                                                               |
| DeferralDueToLargeInScale          | 6     | 2670007 | Deferral due to "Large in Scale" Per MiFID Article 14, publication deferral is permitted if the transaction's volume is large in scale compared to a standard market size, as set in RTS 1/Annex II (thresholds for "large in scale") and RTS 2/Annex III ("LIS and SSTI thresholds"). For ESMA RTS 1 and RTS 2, this is the "LRGS" flag.                                                                                                                               |

### Codeset UnitOfMeasureCodeSet type String (996)

The unit of measure of the underlying commodity upon which the contract is based. Two groups of units of measure enumerations are supported.          Fixed Magnitude UOMs are primarily used in energy derivatives and specify a magnitude (such as, MM, Kilo, M, etc.) and the dimension (such as, watt hours, BTU's) to produce standard fixed measures (such as MWh - Megawatt-hours, MMBtu - One million BTUs).          The second group, Variable Quantity UOMs, specifies the dimension as a single unit without a magnitude (or more accurately a magnitude of one) and uses the UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) field to define the quantity of units per contract. Variable Quantity UOMs are used for both commodities (such as lbs of lean cattle, bushels of corn, ounces of gold) and financial futures.          Examples:          For lean cattle futures contracts, a UnitOfMeasure of 'lbs' with a UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) of 40,000, means each lean cattle futures contract represents 40,000 lbs of lean cattle.          For Eurodollars futures contracts, a UnitOfMeasure of Ccy with a UnitOfMeasureCurrency(1716) of USD and a UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) of 1,000,000, means a Eurodollar futures contract represents 1,000,000 USD.          For gold futures contracts, a UnitOfMeasure is oz_tr (Troy ounce) with a UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) of 1,000, means each gold futures contract represents 1,000 troy ounces of gold.

A tradeable quote is submitted to a market and will result directly in a trade against other orders and quotes in a market.

Two groups of units of measure enumerations are supported.          Fixed Magnitude UOMs are primarily used in energy derivatives and specify a magnitude (such as, MM, Kilo, M, etc.) and the dimension (such as, watt hours, BTU's) to produce standard fixed measures (such as MWh - Megawatt-hours, MMBtu - One million BTUs).          The second group, Variable Quantity UOMs, specifies the dimension as a single unit without a magnitude (or more accurately a magnitude of one) and uses the UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) field to define the quantity of units per contract. Variable Quantity UOMs are used for both commodities (such as lbs of lean cattle, bushels of corn, ounces of gold) and financial futures.          Examples:          For lean cattle futures contracts, a UnitOfMeasure of 'lbs' with a UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) of 40,000, means each lean cattle futures contract represents 40,000 lbs of lean cattle.          For Eurodollars futures contracts, a UnitOfMeasure of Ccy with a UnitOfMeasureCurrency(1716) of USD and a UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) of 1,000,000, means a Eurodollar futures contract represents 1,000,000 USD.          For gold futures contracts, a UnitOfMeasure is oz_tr (Troy ounce) with a UnitOfMeasureQty(1147) of 1,000, means each gold futures contract represents 1,000 troy ounces of gold.                                                                                                                               |

### Component CommissionData (1000)

The CommissionData component block is used to carry commission information such as the type of commission and the rate. Use the CommissionDataGrp component as an alternative if multiple commissions or enhanced attributes are needed. This component may be used to provide aggregated commission data of a given CommType(13) where the CommissionDataGrp maybe used to include the detail splits provided the commission is of the same commission basis type. For example, CommissionData may contain CommType(13) of 3 (Absolute) and a Commission(12) value of "15". CommissionDataGrp may be used to show how this Commission(12) value of "15" is split up as long as the CommissionBasis(2642) is also 3 (Absolute) for each of the instances added together. This method of aggregated commission data may also be applied to this component to provide a total when the instances of the detail splits in CommissionDataGrp contain leg level information (indicated by the usage of CommissionLegRefID(2649) in CommissionDataGrp). Note that it is only possible to aggregate values for a single commission basis type.

### Component MDStatisticParameters (2250)

This component comprises all parameters that can be used to describe the market data statistics. These can be part of the request as well as the response. All parameters defined on the MarketDataStatisticsRequest(35=DO) message should be echoed in the MarketDataStatisticsReport(35=DP) message as the latter could also be sent unsolicited.          The general category and the entities involved in the statistics are defined by MDStatisticType(2456), MDStatisticScope(2457), and MDStatisticIntervalType(2464) and must always be specified. The remaining fields are optional and restrict the data range in one way or another. The time range for the data can either be specified in terms of an interval for which the statistics are typically calculated on a regular basis or in terms of an absolute date and/or time range. MDStatisticScope(2457), MDStatisticSubScope(2458) and MDStatisticScopeType(2459) form a set of scope relationships to filter further the type of statistic being requested or being provided.          It should be noted that some of the enumeration values for MDStatisticScopeType(2459) may not be applicable or useful for a given MDStatisticScope(2457) - e.g. MDStatisticScopeType(2459)=4 (Downward move) is more applicable to prices than to orders or trades.

## Message AccountSummaryReport type CQ (127)

The AccountSummaryReport is provided by the clearinghouse to its clearing members on a daily basis. It contains margin, settlement, collateral and pay/collect data for each clearing member level account type. Clearing member account types will be described through use of the Parties component and PtysSubGrp sub-component.          In certain usages, the clearing members can send the AccountSummaryReport message to the clearinghouse as needed. For example, clearing members can send this message to the clearinghouse to identify the value of collateral for each customer (to satisfy CFTC Legally Segregated Operationally Commingled (LSOC) regulatory reporting obligations).          Clearing organizations can also send the AccountSummaryReport message to regulators to meet regulatory reporting obligations. For example, clearing organizations can use this message to submit daily reports for each clearing member (�CM�) by house origin and by each customer origin for all futures, options, and swaps positions, and all securities positions held in a segregated account or pursuant to a cross margining agreement, to a regulator (e.g. to the CFTC to meet Part 39, Section 39.19 reporting obligations). The Parties component and PtysSubGrp sub-component are used to describe the clearing member number and account type for that report. Net settlement amount or amounts are provided using the SettlementAmountGrp component. Margin requirement amounts are provided using the MarginAmountData component.          The current collateral values for each valid collateral type is provided using the CollateralAmountGrp component. Likewise pay/collect information is provided using the PayCollectGrp component. Margin and pay/collect amounts can optionally be tied to markets and market segments for clearing houses that support multiple markets and market segments.

## Message AllocationInstruction type J (19)

The Allocation Instruction message provides the ability to specify how an order or set of orders should be subdivided amongst one or more accounts. In versions of FIX prior to version 4.4, this same message was known as the Allocation message. Note in versions of FIX prior to version 4.4, the allocation message was also used to communicate fee and expense details from the Sellside to the Buyside. This role has now been removed from the Allocation Instruction and is now performed by the new (to version 4.4) Allocation Report and Confirmation messages.,The Allocation Report message should be used for the Sell-side Initiated Allocation role as defined in previous versions of the protocol.

## Message AllocationReport type AS (78)

Sent from sell-side to buy-side, sell-side to 3rd-party or 3rd-party to buy-side, the Allocation Report (Claim) provides account breakdown of an order or set of orders plus any additional follow-up front-office information developed post-trade during the trade allocation, matching and calculation phase. In versions of FIX prior to version 4.4, this functionality was provided through the Allocation message. Depending on the needs of the market and the timing of "confirmed" status, the role of Allocation Report can be taken over in whole or in part by the Confirmation message.

## Message BidRequest type k (44)

The BidRequest Message can be used in one of two ways depending on which market conventions are being followed.          In the "Non disclosed" convention (e.g. US/European model) the BidRequest message can be used to request a bid based on the sector, country, index and liquidity information contained within the message itself. In the "Non disclosed" convention the entry repeating group is used to define liquidity of the program. See " Program/Basket/List Trading" for an example.          In the "Disclosed" convention (e.g. Japanese model) the BidRequest message can be used to request bids based on the ListOrderDetail messages sent in advance of BidRequest message. In the "Disclosed" convention the list repeating group is used to define which ListOrderDetail messages a bid is being sort for and the directions of the required bids.

## Message Confirmation type AK (70)

The Confirmation messages are used to provide individual trade level confirmations from the sell side to the buy side. In versions of FIX prior to version 4.4, this role was performed by the allocation message. Unlike the allocation message, the confirmation message operates at an allocation account (trade) level rather than block level, allowing for the affirmation or rejection of individual confirmations.

## Message IOI type 6 (7)

Indication of interest messages are used to market merchandise which the broker is buying or selling in either a proprietary or agency capacity. The indications can be time bound with a specific expiration value. Indications are distributed with the understanding that other firms may react to the message first and that the merchandise may no longer be available due to prior trade.          Indication messages can be transmitted in various transaction types; NEW, CANCEL, and REPLACE. All message types other than NEW modify the state of the message identified in IOIRefID.

## Message MarginRequirementInquiry type CH (119)

The purpose of this message is to initiate a margin requirement inquiry for a margin account. The inquiry may be submitted at the detail level or the summary level. It can also be used to inquire margin excess/deficit or net position information. Margin excess/deficit will provide information about the surplus or shortfall compared to the previous trading day or a more recent margin calculation. An inquiry for net position information will trigger one or more PositionReport messages instead of one or more MarginRequirementReport messages.          If the inquiry is made at the detail level, an Instrument block must be provided with the desired level of detail. If the inquiry is made at the summary level, the Instrument block is not provided, implying a summary request is being made. For example, if the inquiring firm specifies the Security Type of �FUT� in the Instrument block, then a detail report will be generated containing the margin requirements for all futures positions for the inquiring account. Similarly, if the inquiry is made at the summary level, the report will contain the total margin requirement aggregated to the margin account level.
